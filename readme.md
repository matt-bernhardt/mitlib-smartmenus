# MITlib SmartMenus Demonstration

This is a demonstration project to see how we can implement our main navigation using [SmartMenus](https://www.smartmenus.org/).

## Context

Our current menu can be seen at https://libraries.mit.edu/ :

![MIT Libraries full navbar](https://matt-bernhardt.github.io/mitlib-smartmenus/img/nav_homepage.png)

This menu exists in simpler form on some pages, and looks like this:

![MIT Libraries simple navbar](https://matt-bernhardt.github.io/mitlib-smartmenus/img/nav_simple.png)

Examples of this navbar are at:
- [MIT Quicksearch](https://lib.mit.edu/)
- [Style guide](http://mitlibraries.github.io/mitlib-style/)
- [Distinctive Collections](https://libraries.mit.edu/distinctive-collections/)
